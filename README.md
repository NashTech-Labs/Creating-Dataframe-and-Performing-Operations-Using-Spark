# Counting M&M for Cookie Monster
Spark program that reads a file with over 100,000 entries (where each
row or line has a <state, mnm_color, count> ) and computes and aggregates the
counts for each color and state. These aggregated counts tell us the colors of M&Ms
favored by students in each state.
